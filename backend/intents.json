Presidency University, Kolkata, is a second major public research university in West Bengal. It offers admission to multiple post-graduate courses, including an M.Sc. In Biotechnology. To apply, you must fulfil the eligibility criteria, which is as follows:You must have graduated with honours or major from a recognised university or institute in any branch of the life sciences that includes Chemistry or you must have graduated in biotechnology. You must also have secured a minimum of 55% marks or a 6.0 grade at the graduation level. After fulfilling eligibility criteria, you will have to apply online on the official website of the university. The application forms for postgraduate courses are usually available in the month of September. After registrations are over, admission will be done on a merit basis, and academic scores will be used to determine the general merit rank (GMR) of individual students and to prepare the general merit list. Allotment of seats or admission will be done based on GMR only (not on category ranks). The score for the merit list will be calculated as per this formula: 75% of the honours or major grade point average plus 25% of the 10+2 grade point average. The total score wise list will be published on official website in order of merit. According to the website of the university, the tentative last date of admission is October 31,  2022."
